        <p>To give an idea of how different the world was when Paramore released their last album, Alex Smith was the Chiefs starting quarterback. During nearly six years of downtime, band members released multiple solo albums, leaving fans to question if they’d ever hear new material from the pop/rock trio.

        Thankfully, after six months of trickling out singles, Paramore’s sixth album, This Is Why, has arrived. As the lead single, opening cut and title track “This Is Why” does a lot of heavy lifting. Fortunately, “This is Why” is up to the task, serving a perfect encapsulation of the sense of dread, fear and survivor’s guilt that have engulfed the world since early 2020.
        
        “This is why I don’t leave the house,” singer Hayley Williams bellows on the chorus. “You say the coast is clear/But you won’t catch me out/Oh, why?
        
        This is why.” The feeling of being overwhelmed and uncertain carries into the rocking second track, “The News.” Williams and her bandmates touch on these themes several more times across the album’s 10 songs and 37 minutes. “Big Man, Little Dignity” targets men wealthy enough to live without consequences for their greed and selfishness. “C’est comme ça,” the second single, details the time when a chiropractic appointment was a big social occasion. Translated to “it is what it is,” the resignation of the lyrics are countered by a hyperactive guitars and a bouncy chorus.
        
        In the run-up to This Is Why, Paramore said they were inspired by the guitar-driven indie rock they grew up on in the early ‘00s. There are echoes of Bloc Party, Futureheads, OK Go and Foals across the album, but also early ‘80s New Wave. By tweaking their sound, Paramore not only make This Is Why sonically rewarding, but keeps the often grim lyrics at bay. -Joel Francis</p>

        <p>Loaded is the fourth and what many hardcore fans consider to be the final studio album by legendary art-rock band Velvet Underground.
        It would be the last album to feature founding member Lou Reed, who quit shortly before “Loaded’s” release in 1970. Other original members Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker would leave VU in 1971.
        Though she was credited on the album, Tucker doesn’t actually appear on Loaded (she was pregnant at the time of the recording). Drumming duties were handled by bassist Doug Yule, recording engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanero and Yule’s brother Billy.
        The album’s title is a humorous double entendre referencing Atlantic’s request for a record “loaded with hits” and the band’s association with heavy drug use and beatnik culture.
        The sound of “Loaded” is a clear departure from VU’s three previous records. It was widely aimed at a more commercial sound in hope of increased radio airplay.
        Even though Reed is credited with being the main songwriter, Yule took on a larger role in the band as far as arrangements and singing. He handles lead vocals on three of the albums ten tracks.
        Even though “Loaded” never achieved the commercial success it aspired to, it did produce some of VU’s most popular songs including “Who Love’s the Sun” and “Sweet Jane.”
        This limited edition Crystal-Clear vinyl sounds amazing. If you missed out on the 2015 45th anniversary reissue this a great chance to pick up a copy of this iconic album. – Major Matt</p>

        <p>Gill Scott-Heron was only 20 years old when his debut album, Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, was recorded in 1970. Still very much a newcomer, Scott-Heron already had a book of poetry and novel to his name.

        The 14 tracks on Small Talk are very informed by Scott-Heron’s poetry. The album’s 45 minutes lie somewhere between spoken word, jazz and what would become rap. Backed only by two percussionists, Scott-Heron delivers blistering diatribes in front of an audience on the civil rights movement, race, homophobia and the state of America in general.
        
        Scott-Heron’s signature number “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” opens the album. While the words are the same, this early version lacks the urgent bassline of the better-know interpretation found on 1971’s Pieces of a Man.
        
        While most of the world was celebrating Neil Armstrong’s giant leap on the moon, Scott-Heron penned “Whitey on the Moon.” Using succinct, demanding words, Scott-Heron decries the use of taxpayer money on lunar missions when so many Americans lack access to healthcare and suffer in poverty.
        
        On “Evolution (and Flashback)” Scott-Heron looks at the passing of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. and the future of the civil rights movement. Scott-Heron sits down at the piano and sings “Who Will Pay Reparations on my Soul” foreshadowing the decade of provocative music he would make with pianist Brian Jackson throughout the 1970s.
        
        Many of the pieces on Small Talk are still potent and relevant, but the homophobia of “The Subject Was F—ts” mars its author and is the album’s only blemish. – Joel Francis</p>
